# Weather App

## General Info
The purpose of this app is to get current weather of city you type in textbox.
You can enter your city regardless of the semantics of uppercase and lowercase letters, 
it's case insensitive. App is connected to weather API (https://openweathermap.org/)
where does get weather information. 
If you type your city name wrong instead of weather information there'll be text saying
'Invalid city name'. 
In weather app there is also a button called 'help' which explains how app works.
Also you can simply download WeatherApp.exe and run main.exe in it.

Note: Keep in mind that API key that I used from https://openweathermap.org/ is unique
so you need to go to website, log in and copy your own API key.
